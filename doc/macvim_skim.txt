======================================================================
Section 1. Usage                                *MacVim_Skim_Usage*

This has tools for working with SyncTeX to jump from the current line
in the Vim to the matching line in the PDF file, and back again.

This plugin offers some key bindings under <LocalLeader> to
compile and jump to the PDF.

The main improvement when jumping back from the PDF is that it
will attempt to only load the TeX source in the MacVim instance
that already has the source open in a buffer.

It is currently tied to Skim for jumping from Vim to the PDF.

======================================================================
Section 2. Installation                         *MacVim_Skim_Installation*
This plugin requires some additional installation, namely a shell script
`macvim-load-line` which is distributed with this plugin, which needs to
be added to your path. It should be invoked as `macvim-load-line <file>
<line>`.

In addition, Skim needs to be told to use `macvim-load-line`, either
through the Preferences window, or directly by running these: >

    defaults write net.sourceforge.skim-app.skim SKTeXEditorCommand "macvim-load-line"
    defaults write net.sourceforge.skim-app.skim SKTeXEditorArguments "'\"%file\" %line'"

======================================================================
Section 3. Mappings                             *MacVim_Skim_Mappings*
All of these mappings save the current buffer first.

<LocalLeader>v
    The simplest of the commands, this jumps to the current line in the PDF

<LocalLeader>p
    This command first compiles the PDF using `pdftex`, then jumps to the
    current line.
    The precise command is configurable in g:|macvim_skim_app_path|.

<LocalLeader>m
    This command first compiles using `make`, then jumps to the current line.

These next commands return focus to Vim afterwards, instead of leaving
the focus on the PDF viewer.

<LocalLeader>r
    This jumps the to current line in the PDF, then refocuses Vim.

<LocalLeader>t
    This compiles the PDF using `pdftex`, then jumps to the current line
    in the PDF viewer, and then returns focus to Vim.

Section 4. Variables                                *MacVim_Skim_Variables*

                                                    *macvim_skim_app_path*
'g:macvim_skim_app_path'    The path to 'Skim.app'.  If not set
                            it defaults to '/Applications/Skim.app'

                                                    *macvim_skim_out_dir*
'g:macvim_skim_out_dir'     This will control where MacVim_Skim looks
                            for the '.pdf' file associated with the '.tex'
                            current buffer.  By default, it is set to '.',
                            the current directory, but another common value
                            it 'out/'.
                                                    *macvim_skim_pdftex_command*
'g:macvim_skim_pdftex_command'
                            This is the command used to compile the TeX
                            document.  By default it is set to >

                            'pdflatex -synctex=1 --interaction=nonstopmode
                                -output-directory=g:macvim_skim_out_dir
                                -aux-directory=g:macvim_skim_out_dir %:p'
